def get_contribution(savings,years_to_save, deposit, value):
    '''
    Calculates the optimal split of monthly savings between a Lifetime ISA (LISA) and an S&P 500 investment 
    to achieve a target house deposit within a specified time frame.

    Parameters:
    - Savings (float): Current savings already accumulated towards the goal.
    - years_to_save (int): Number of years planned for saving to reach the target.
    - deposit (float): Target deposit amount needed for the house purchase.
    - value (float): Total estimated purchase price of the house.

    Returns:
    - lisa_monthly (int): Recommended monthly contribution to the Lifetime ISA, factoring in the Â£4,000 annual limit.
    - SP_monthly (int): Recommended monthly investment in an S&P 500 fund to meet the remainder of the goal, 
    based on a projected annual return rate.
